### Elegant Starship Config
starship.rs is a cross-shell prompt which allows you to configure the appearance of a lot of common shells through config settings in a TOML file.

I've based mine on @cris-maillo's script and other bits and bobs I found online (I'd recommend exploring starships' discord for further info).
